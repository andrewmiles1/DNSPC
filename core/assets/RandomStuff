EYYYYYYYOOOOO these are random Ideas I have and stuff I'm taking track of when I code

Sounds needed:
upgrade sound 
slime attack sound
bat attack sound
button click sound
sword whiff sound
sword hit sound
door open sound

Chests that will be made:
upgrade point chest, just one per level
money chest
and then the button somehwere. Not a chest, just hidden somewhere.
